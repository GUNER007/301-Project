# 301-Project
The purpose of this page is to outline the purpose and process of Paulina Gomez and Christopher Hassett's MAE 301 project.

During this project we will test two different types of woods with four different types of adhesive in order to determine which combination of wood and glue would provide the sturdiest building material.
We will be comparing our data with that of this report (https://woodgears.ca/joint_strength/glue.html) and this report (https://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fplgtr113/ch09.pdf).

The first report has the different types of adhesive and the amount of pound-force required to either break the adhesive or the wood.
The second report is the adhesive bonding of different types of materials.

Our project will consist of using spruce which is one of the woods that is under the "bonds easily" category and rosewood which is one from the "bonds with difficulty" category according to the second report. We will also be using four different types of adhesive from the first report: hot glue, carpenters glue, gorilla glue, and epoxy. We will be using the cross grain joint from the first report for both types of wood and all different adhesives.

Our null hypothesis is that the wood that bonds difficulty will hold better than the wood that bonds easily and that gorilla glue will hold better than the other adhesives.
Our hypothesis is that the wood that bonds easily will hold better than the wood that bonds difficulty and that carpenters glue will hold better than the other adhesives.

To measure the strength of the glue or initial plan is to use one of the labs at ASU to measure the amount of stress on the wood and glue. If we are unable to use the labs then we will use normal weights and increase at a steady increment until there is a breakage.
